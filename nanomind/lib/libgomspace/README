LIBGOMSPACE
-----------

This library contains device drivers, freertos and utilities used by GomSpace products.

The device drivers are layered so that platform independant drivers reside in /dev and 
platform specific drivers in /dev-arm for example.

FreeRTOS is ported and running on AVR8, AVR32, ARM and PC

The gomspace shell is also included in the 'gosh' folder.
